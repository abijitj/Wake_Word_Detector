# Wake Word Detector - Arise

This is a wake word detector that recognizes when a speaker says the word "Arise" in English. 

## File Organization

Here is the general organization of this repo.

```
The `Data` folder contains all the training and test data for the PyTorch model. 

`train.py` trains and tests the PyTorch model using the data (stored in csv files) generated by `process.py`. 

## Usage 

### Dependencies

To fully utilize this codebase, you will need to download all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. 

### Running Existing Model 

You can try out the existing model by running the following command.

```
python ./src/continuous_listen.py
```

This will start an infinite loop (which can be terminated with CTRL+C) where the model tells you if it ever hears "Arise." It might look something like this.

### Recording New Data
If you would like to record your own data to add to the dataset, you can do so by running the following command. 

```
python ./src/record.py [auto/manual] [saved-dir] [start-point]
```

You can select between `auto` or `manual` mode. In auto mode, the computer will continuously record a set number of 2 second sample audio clips. In manual mode, you will be asked to press Enter to initiate the recording of each 2 second sample. 

Then, you can specify where to save these recordings in `[saved-dir]`. To make the data processing step easier, it would be beneficial if you can save these recordings into the `./Data/train` or `./Data/test` directories in the appropriately labelled negative or positive directoy. 

Finally, `start-point` tells the program how to start numbering the names of these audio files. For example, if it's 5, then your recordings will be saved as `5.wav`, `6.wav`, `7.wav` and so on. 


### Data Processing 

Run the following command to process the data in the `./Data/train/` and `./Data/test/` directories. 

```
python ./src/process.py 
```

All the data will be labelled and saved as .csv files within the test or train directories (one for train, one for test). Note, these files are not human-readable because they have been pickled in order to be processed faster. However, a human-readable csv file is also saved in `./Data/train/` called `train_mfccs2.csv` for reference. 

### Training 

In order to train the model using the data in `./Data/`, simply run the following command. 

```
python ./src/train.py ["save"] [model-name]
```

Please note that the last two optional arguments can be used if you want to save the model into the `./models/` directory. An example use of this would look ike: `python ./src/train.py save ARISE`. 

### Running Saved Model 
Finally, in order to run a new saved model, go into the `./src/continuous_listen.py` file and change the file path in the `torch.load()` function to the file path of the saved model that you would like to run. Then, run the program.
